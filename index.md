## Participation
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

The purpose of this chapter is to support the goals of the foundation and to advance local application security technical expertise by establishing a local community, encouraging participation, creating strategic partnerships with local institutions and facilitating events led by the community for the community.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter Leader Handbook](/www-policy/operational/chapter-handbook-existing.html). To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement.html) and then contact any of the local chapter leaders with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
